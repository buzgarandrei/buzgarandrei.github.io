										<h2>I am a Computer Science and Mathematics Graduate</h2>
										<p>I know programing and mathematics(maybe to much mathematics)</p>
									</header>

									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>I was born on 9th of July 1997 in Cluj-Napoca. 
										I always loved making connections, meeting new people and environments. 
										I like very much walking in the nature, going into forests and climbing hills.
										 When I am fit, I like to play basketball and football with my mates.</p>

									<h3>Education and Experience</h3>
									<p> During middleschool time I studied at Ioan Bob, a very good school,
										well renowned here in Cluj-Napoca, special thanks to my teachers at that time: Iepure Lucia, Motu Iancu, Vaida Maria, Gorea Petru, Papp Lazlo, Timar Radu, Rus Voichita, Iliuta Edith, Moldovan Otilia, Sfarlea Lenuta and Boanca Claudiu. I studied in highschool at
										"Liceul de Informatica Tiberiu Popoviciu", where we learned informatics and programming at 
										high level, from that time being familiar with Algorithms and Logical thinking. 
										Personally I owe a lot to teachers from there, especially from Mathematics and Informatics,
									    to ladies Balan Gabriela, Balan Adina, Cheres Adriana and Zeriu Flavia.</p>

									<p>Next step in my development was studying computer science at a higher level, 
										so I went for Computer Science admision at Bachelor Degree program at the 
										Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Cluj-Napoca. 
										In the end I was admitted at the Computer Science and Mathematics program at the same Faculty.
										Last year I was accepted at the summer internship of 2019 organized by Artsoft Consult, with Java tehnologies.
										There I learned about Http protocols, Servlet and JSP tehnologies, deploying and container servers, 
										such as Apache, Tomcat, Glassfish, Jenkins. Then persistance and MCV development, with The 
										old Spring with XML configurations and JPA/ Hibernate. 
										personally I implemented a Voting System, where people could register in the application and vote at specific voting sessions,
										based on the time interval of the availability of the session, at the end of the session, the result of the candidates would be displayed.
